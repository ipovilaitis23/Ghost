        <p class="description">
        Ghost is a Swedish rock band, formed in 2006 by frontman Tobias Forge. Initially, the identity of the band and especially its frontman was kept secret - while other members of the band would wear black hooded robes and be called "Nameless Ghouls", Forge would go by "Papa Emeritus", dressed in Papal regalia and his face painted to resemble a skull. The band is known for its theatrical appearance and performances. At the end of every album cycle, the current frontman, or 'Papa', is replaced by a successor. Today, the band is fronted by Papa Emeritus IV.<br>Anonymity is a major characteristic of Ghost; prior to 2017, the members had not publicly revealed their names, and the group's five instrumentalists are only referred to as "Nameless Ghouls". In 2017, due to a lawsuit involving former band members, Tobias Forge publicly revealed himself as the frontman of the band for the first time. <br><br>To date, the band has released four full-length albums: <em>Opus Eponymous</em> in 2010, <em>Infestissumam</em> in 2013, <em>Meliora</em> in 2015, <em>Prequelle</em> in 2018 and <em>Impera</em> in 2022. The band's sound is best described as hard rock with a very notable Swedish pop music influence (Forge's favorite band is ABBA for good reason).
